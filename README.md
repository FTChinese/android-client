## Localization

```
<resource type>-b+<language code>[+<country code>]
```

The locale is a combination of the language and the country. The language is defined by the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) standard while the country is defined by the [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) standard.


Locale change is not easy to implement at runtime. Just prepare localized resources and leave it to the system to handle.
